# Python-Rock Paper Scissors & WAR
Project for a summer camp demo: 
-------------------------------
Simple Final Project
Using what we have learned in these tutorials, create a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors.
Where two players are able to input values (or “play hands”) and the program outputs who wins.
-------------------------------
For more advance users create a game of War
The user inputs a card value (Ace, 2, 3, etc) and the program randomly selects a second card value to determine if the user wins, loses, or goes to War (there is a tie). If the answer is a tie, have the program and the user go to War and then determine a winner. If a second tie occurs, let the tie go to the user. Then try enhancing your program so that if a second tie occurs, you again get to go to War, until a winner is determined.
